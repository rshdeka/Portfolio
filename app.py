    1. **Automated Data Flow pipeline**
    - Automated the data flow pipeline for Optum Bank's Customer Support data. The automated system consisted of loading Customer 
    Support chats from Azure Databricks, extraction of key information using Python, SQL, and Prompt Engineering (e.g., Product, 
    Category, Sub-Category, Sentiment, Root Cause, Responsible Party, Prevention Method), and storage to Cosmos DB for further 
    analysis, which achieved an accuracy rate of approx. 96.7% in aligning with the manual entries. Scheduled a Databricks job to run at 
    regular intervals, to ensure that Cosmos DB is consistently updated with latest data.

    2. **Automated real-time Chatbot Evaluation workflow**
    - Implemented a real-time automated Evaluation Workflow using Python for calculating evaluation metrics (e.g., similarity, fluency, 
    relevance scores, etc.) to assess individual chatbot interactions as well as entire conversations, triggered via Azure Functions and 
    Azure Event Grid for event-driven processing, with results stored in Cosmos DB to enhance the quality of our chatbot responses.
    
   3. **Automated on-demand Newsletter Generation**
    - Developed an automated, on-demand Newsletter Generation system using Azure Functions, Python APIs and Prompt Engineering
    to provide summarized insights into Customer Support issues, evaluate resolution effectiveness, propose strategies to address root 
    causes, and incorporated visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs). Enabled dynamic update of Newsletter with selected chats to 
    provide dynamic insights, thus increasing stakeholder engagement by approx. 80%.
                
    4. **Automated data migration**
    - Facilitated seamless data migration across various platforms (Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Databricks, Power BI) using Python APIs, 
    ensuring 100% data integrity across platforms.

    1. **Automated Code Documentation Generation for GitHub**
    - Automated Code Documentation Generation for GitHub repositories via GitHub Action to trigger on new PRs, utilizing Python, 
    Azure Functions, and Prompt Engineering to generate documentation on existing files, as well as newly added files within the PR, 
    which is then committed back to the repository. This system ensures that the documentation for repositories is kept 100% updated, 
    while also helping new joiners understand the code within the repository.

    2. **Automated FHIR Test Data creation API**
    - Automated FHIR Test Data Creation by developing a solution using Python, Azure Functions, and Prompt Engineering to generate 
    FHIR bundles including key healthcare resource-types (Patient, Condition, Encounter, Appointment, Observation, Service Request, 
    Medication Request, Allergy Intolerance). The API allows test data creation with dynamic customization by providing the ability to 
    override any desired parameter with user-provided values. This solution significantly accelerated QE test cycles by reducing manual 
    efforts for test data creation by approx. 95% (from 45 minutes to 3 minutes per patient).

    3. **Agentic Framework for UI Browser Testing**
    - Automated UI Browser Testing by utilizing an Agentic AI framework with Langchain, BrowserUse, and Playwright. Leveraged
    Prompt Engineering to dynamically generate Playwright automation functions (requiring only slight modifications to accommodate 
    specific UI elements) based on test cases, and integrated with the Langchain model (AzureChatOpenAI). Utilized BrowserUse to 
    instruct the AI Agent on executing test cases, with Playwright serving as a fallback mechanism to extend the agent and facilitate 
    custom function calls. This solution increased automated test coverage by approx. 60%, reducing manual efforts by the QE team.

    - Analyzed and optimized recommendation algorithms for food commodities.
    
    2. **Delivery Route Optimization**
    - Determined the proper order in which packages should be allocated for delivery. Implemented K-Means 
    clustering to group delivery points based on geographical proximity, and utilized the 2-Opt algorithm to 
    iteratively improve delivery routes and find the most efficient routes for deliveries, minimizing the total 
    travel distance and re-ordering the delivery data according to the optimized routes.
